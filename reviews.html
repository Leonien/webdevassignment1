                      <p class="review-article-p">MDN Web Docs, formerly known as the Mozilla Developer Network, 
                        is a popular web development resource that is provided by Mozilla, who are the creators of the web browser Mozilla Firefox. 
                        Through MDN Web Docs, Mozilla provides both existing Web Developers and people that are interested in diving into the world of
                        Web Development with a vast wealth of information relating to the languages that are most commonly used when creating a website, such as 
                        <a href="glossary.html#html">HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</a>, 
                        <a href="glossary.html#css">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a> and <a href="glossary.html#javascript">JavaScript</a>.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Upon first visiting the MDN Web Docs website, users are greeted with a short message stating that the resources on MDN Web Docs are “Resources for developers, by developers.”, 
                        alongside being given the ability to search the MDN Web Docs website for any term relating to Web Development that they can think of. Alongside the ability to search for a specific term, three links are also provided, 
                        which are “Web Technologies”, “Learn web development” and “Developer Tools” respectively. 
                        Each of these three links points web developers and those starting out with learning web development to information that they may find useful. 
                      </p>
                      <p>For instance, under “Web Technologies”, users are brought to a page linking to multiple different resources relating to the underlying technologies that power the 
                        <a href="glossary.html#www">World Wide Web (WWW)</a>. 
                        If a user wanted to find out more about HTML, JavaScript or even HTTP, this is where they might turn to.
                        <br>
                        Under “Learn web development”, Mozilla instead provide several links to articles that are structured in a similar way to mini courses, 
                        mostly with the intention of taking users with no knowledge of web development to a level where they at least understand the very basics of web development.
                        <br>
                        Under “Developer Tools”, Mozilla provide information on how to access the Developer Tools included with their Firefox browser, 
                        with some examples the Page Inspector, JavaScript Debugger and Responsive Design Mode. Whilst this information is mainly centered around Firefox, 
                        this information should also apply to other Web Browsers such as Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome.
                      </p>

                    <div class="review-column">
                      <h4 class="review-article-p">How useful is it as a learning resource?</h4>
                      
                      <p class="review-article-p">In regard to the usefulness of MDN Web Docs as a learning resource for new web developers, 
                        I can confidently say that MDN Web Docs would be a good starting point for anyone that is just starting out on their Web Development journey. 
                        With the structured courses that are provided, in addition to the ability to look up the definition of anything relating to either HTML, CSS or JavaScript, 
                        learners can use this information to further their understand of the technologies and practices involved in the world of Web Development.
                        <br>
                        For instance, if someone is unsure about what the meaning of the &lt;section&gt; element is, 
                        they would be able to easily find a definition of it, and examples of how that specific element is used in normal HTML markup.
                      </p>
                      <p>Depending on how some people prefer to learn, however, 
                        learning solely from a website such as MDN Web Docs may turn out to be daunting. If this happens to be the case, 
                        MDN Web Docs can still be used as a supplement to learning core web technologies from resources such as 
                        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> or <a href="https://www.lynda.com/">Lynda.com</a>, 
                        both of which take a more visual and/or interactive approach to learning.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="review-column">
                      <h4 class="review-article-heading">Conclusion</h4>
      
                      <p class="review-article-p">After looking over the MDN Web Docs website, I can say that it is a useful resource for both existing web developers and new web developers alike. 
                        Not only does MDN Web Docs contain a vast wealth of information from which people new to web development can learn from, and from which existing web developers can use to further their understanding, 
                        but it also contains information that is regularly kept up-to-date, when compared to a website such as <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>. 
                        Since the information on MDN Web Docs is provided by Mozilla, users can also be assured that the information provided is accurate, due to it being provided by a company that has experience in the world of web development.
